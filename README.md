# Project Overview:
The Flight Booking App allows users to effortlessly search for available flights and book single or multiple seats, all within a secure, user-friendly platform. To ensure seamless bookings, users can only proceed after signing in.

# Tech Stack:

Frontend: Built with ReactJS and state management using Redux Toolkit. I utilized Font Awesome v5 icons for a modern interface and implemented robust form validations both on the frontend and backend.

Backend: Developed using NodeJS, with APIs handling signup, login, user management, flight data operations, and seat booking. Key libraries include CORS, mongoose, body-parser, express, and winston-mongodb.

Security: Session storage is used for storing JSON Web Tokens, ensuring secure and persistent user sessions.

# Features:

User Interface: The home page displays all available and booked flights, viewable in either a grid or table format to suit user preferences.

Functionality: The app includes comprehensive error handling, user authentication and authorization, and detailed responses for all potential error codes.

Implementation: Despite the tight timeline of just 3 working days, I successfully delivered a fully functional application. Please note, mobile responsiveness was not addressed within this timeframe.
