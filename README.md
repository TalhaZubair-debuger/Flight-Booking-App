# Flight Booking App

It was an internship evaluation project, which led me to the Associate Software Engineer's role.
The Flight Booking App's purpose is to show users all the available flights, search for flights, and let them book single/multiple seats. Users can only book flights after signing in.

# Implementation

I have used ReactJs for front-end and Redux Toolkit for state management. I have implemented form validation Frontend as well as in Backend. Font awesome v5 icons are used inside the application. I have used session storage for storing JSON Web Tokens. Home [page lists all the flights available and already booked, which can be shown either in grid form or in tanel. The table shows more data than Grid, but both were implemented as per project requirements.

NodeJs is used for Backend API implementation, and CORS, mongoose, body-parser, express, and winston-mongodb. The APIs I have written in the application are signup user, login user, get user, add multiple flights, add single flight, all flights, get single flight, search flights, book seat.

The project contains complete error handling, form handling, user authentication, authorization, page not found, and all the possible error codes and their responses are implemented.

Note: This project was built in 3 working days so no mobile responsiveness is handled.
